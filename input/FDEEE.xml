    <section title="PP Overview" id="sec-ppoverview">
      	The purpose of the set of Collaborative Protection Profiles (cPPs) for Full Drive
      	Encryption (FDE): Authorization Acquisition (AA) and Encryption Engine (EE) is to provide
      	requirements for Data-at-Rest protection against unauthorized access or disclosure of stored data on a lost device. 
        These cPPs allow FDE solutions based in software and/or hardware to meet the requirements for Data-at-Rest protection. 
        The form factor for a storage device may vary, but could include: hard disk drives/solid state
      	drives in servers, workstations, laptops, mobile devices, tablets, and external media. A
      	hardware solution could be a Self-Encrypting Drive or other hardware-based solutions; the
      	interface (USB, SATA, etc.) used to connect the storage device to the host machine is outside
      	the scope of this cPP.<h:br/><h:br/>
        
        Full Drive Encryption encrypts all data (with certain exceptions) on the storage device and 
        permits access to the data only after successful authorization to the FDE solution. The 
        exceptions include the necessity to leave a portion of the storage device (the size may vary
        based on implementation) unencrypted for such things as the Master Boot Record (MBR) or other
        AA/EE pre-authentication software. These FDE cPPs interpret the term “full drive encryption” 
        to allow FDE solutions to leave a portion of the storage device unencrypted so long as it 
        does not contain plaintext user or plaintext authorization data.<h:br/><h:br/>
        
        Since the FDE cPPs support a variety of solutions, two cPPs describe the requirements for the
        FDE components shown in Figure 1.  
        
        <h:p><figure entity="images/fde-components.png" title="FDE Components" id="toe-figure-1"/></h:p>

          The FDE cPP - Authorization Acquisition describes the requirements for the Authorization Acquisition
          piece and details the necessary security requirements and assurance activities necessary to interact with a user 
          and result in the availability of a Border Encryption Value (BEV).<h:br/><h:br/>
          The FDE cPP - Encryption Engine describes the requirements for the Encryption Engine piece and details
          the necessary security requirements and assurance activities for the actual encryption and
          decryption of the data by the DEK. Each cPP will also have a set of core requirements for management
          functions, proper handling of cryptographic keys, updates performed in a trusted manner, audit and self-tests.<h:br/><h:br/> 
          The Target of Evaluation (TOE) description defines the scope and functionality of the Encryption Engine, and
          the Security Problem Definition describes the assumptions made about the operating
          environment and the threats to the EE that the cPP requirements address.

       Full Drive Encryption solutions vary with implementation and vendor combinations.<h:br/><h:br/> 
       Vendors must evaluate products that provide both components of the Full Disk
        Encryption Solution (AA and EE) against both cPPs, although that could be done in a single evaluation
        with one ST. A vendor that provides a single component of an FDE solution would only evaluate
        against the applicable cPP. The FDE cPP is divided into two documents to allow labs to
        independently evaluate solutions tailored to one cPP or the other. When a customer acquires
        an FDE solution, they will either obtain a single vendor product that meets the AA + EE cPPs
        or two products, one of which meets the AA and the other of which meets the EE cPPs.<h:br/><h:br/>

     <section title="TOE Overview" id="sec-TOEoverview">
        The Target of Evaluation (TOE) for this cPP is either the Encryption Engine or a combined
        evaluation of the set of cPPs for FDE (Authorization Acquisition or Encryption Engine).<h:br/><h:br/> 
        
        The following sections provide an overview of the functionality of the FDE EE as well as the security capabilities.

     
     <section title="Encryption Engine Introduction" id="sec-TOEencryption-engine-introduction">
      
      The Encryption Engine (EE) objectives focus on data encryption, policy enforcement, and key
      management. The EE is responsible for the generation, update, archival, recovery, protection,
      and destruction of the DEK and other intermediate keys under its control. The EE receives a
      Border Encryption Value (BEV) from the AA. The EE uses that BEV for the decryption of the DEK although other
      intermediate keys may exist in between those two points. Key Encryption Keys (KEKs) wrap
      other keys, notably the DEK or other intermediary keys which chain to the DEK. Key Releasing
      Keys (KRKs) authorize the EE to release either the DEK or other intermediary keys which chain
      to the DEK. These keys only differ in the functional use.<h:br/><h:br/>
      
      The EE determines whether to allow or deny a requested action based on the KEK or KRK
      provided by the AA. Possible requested actions include but are not limited to changing of
      encryption keys, decryption of data, and key sanitization of encryption keys (including the 
      DEK). The EE may offer additional policy enforcement to prevent access to ciphertext or the
      unencrypted portion of the storage device. Additionally the EE may provide encryption support
      for multiple users on an individual basis.<h:br/><h:br/>
       
      Figure 2 illustrates the components within EE and its relationship with AA.
          
      <figure entity="images/fde-encryption_engine.png" title="Encryption Engine Details" id="toe-figure-2"/>
     </section>
       
     <section title="Encryption Engine Security Capabilities" id="sec-TOEencryption-engine_security_capabilities">
       The Encryption Engine is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the data is encrypted using a
       prescribed set of algorithms. The EE manages the decryption of the data on the storage device
       through decryption of the DEK based on the validity of the BEV provided by the AA. It also
       manages administrative functions, such as changing the DEK, managing the BEVs required for
       decrypting or releasing the DEK, managing the intermediate wrapping keys under its control,
       and performing a key sanitization.<h:br/><h:br/>
       
       The EE may provide key archiving and recovery functionality. The EE may manage the
       archiving and recovery itself, or interface with the AA to perform this function. It may also
       offer configurable features, which restricts the movement of keying material and disables
       recovery functionality.<h:br/><h:br/>
       
       The foremost security objective of encrypting storage devices is to force an adversary to
       perform an exhaustive search against a prohibitively large key space in order to recover the
       DEK or other intermediate keys. The EE uses approved cryptography to generate, handle, and
       protect keys to force an adversary who obtains an unpowered lost or stolen platform without
       the authorization factors or intermediate keys to exhaust the encryption key space of
       intermediate keys or DEK to obtain the data. The EE randomly generates DEKs and – in some
       cases - intermediate keys. The EE uses DEKs in a symmetric encryption algorithm in an
       appropriate mode along with appropriate initialization vectors for that mode to encrypt storage
       units (e.g. sectors or blocks) on the storage device. The EE either encrypts the DEK with a
       KEK or an intermediate key.<h:br/><h:br/>
       
       This version of the cPP includes additional security features, including advanced power saving
       requirements and firmware signing requirements.
      </section>
    
      <section title="Interface/Boundary" id="sec-TOEInterface-Boundary">
        The interface and boundary between the AA and the EE will vary based on the implementation. 
        If one vendor provides the entire FDE solution, then it may choose to not implement an interface between the AA and EE components. 
        If a vendor provides a solution for one of the components, then the assumptions below state that the channel between the two components 
        is sufficiently secure. Although standards and specifications exist for the interface between AA and EE components, the cPP does 
        not require vendors to follow the standards in this version.
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="sec-TOEdescription">
      <section title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
      The environment in which the EE functions may differ depending on the boot stage of the
      platform in which it operates; see Figure 3. Aspects of initialization, and perhaps authorization
      may be performed in the Pre-Boot environment, while provisioning, encryption, decryption
      and management functionality are likely performed in the Operating System environment.
      Some of these aspects may occur in both environments.
      
      The Operating System environment may make a full range of services available to the
      Encryption Engine, including hardware drivers, cryptographic libraries, and perhaps other
      services external to the TOE.
      
      The Pre-Boot environment is much more constrained with limited capabilities. This
      environment turns on the minimum number of peripherals and loads only those drivers
      necessary to bring the platform from a cold start to executing a fully functional operating
      system with running applications.
      
      The EE TOE may include or leverage features and functions within the operational
      environment.

    <sec:Threats>
        This section provides a narrative that describes how the requirements mitigate the mapped
        threats. A requirement may mitigate aspects of multiple threats. A requirement may only 
        mitigate a threat in a limited way. Some requirements are optional, either because the TSF
        fully mitigates the threat without the additional requirements being claimed or because the
        TSF relies on its Operational Environment to provide the functionality that is described by
        the optional requirements.<h:br/><h:br/>
        
        A threat consists of a threat agent, an asset and an adverse action of that threat agent on
        that asset. The threat agents are the entities that put the assets at risk if an adversary
        obtains a lost or stolen storage device. Threats drive the functional requirements for the 
        Target of Evaluation (TOE). For instance, one threat below is T.UNAUTHORIZED_DATA_ACCESS. 
        The threat agent is the possessor (unauthorized user) of a lost or stolen storage device.
        The asset is the data on the storage device, while the adverse action is to attempt to 
        obtain those data from the storage device. This threat drives the functional requirements
        for the storage device encryption (TOE) to authorize who can use the TOE to access the hard
        disk and encrypt/decrypt the data. Since possession of the KEK, DEK, intermediate keys, 
        authorization factors, submasks, and random numbers or any other values that contribute
        to the creation of keys or authorization factors could allow an unauthorized user to 
        defeat the encryption, this SPD considers key material equivalent to the data in importance
        and they appear among the other assets addressed below.<h:br/><h:br/>
      
        It is important to reemphasize at this point that this collaborative Protection Profile 
        does not expect the product (TOE) to defend against the possessor of the lost or stolen
        storage device who can introduce malicious code or exploitable hardware components into the 
        Target of Evaluation (TOE) or the Operational Environment. It assumes that the user 
        physically protects the TOE and that the Operational Environment provides sufficient
        protection against logical attacks. One specific area where a conformant TOE offers 
        some protection is in providing updates to the TOE; other than this area, though, 
        this cPP mandates no other countermeasures. Similarly, these requirements do not 
        address the “lost and found” hard disk problem, where an adversary may have taken
        the hard disk, compromised the unencrypted portions of the boot device (e.g., MBR,
        boot partition), and then made it available to be recovered by the original user so
        that they would execute the compromised code.

		  <threat id="t-auth-guessing" name="T.AUTHORIZATION_GUESSING">
		    <description>
		      Threat agents may exercise host software to repeatedly guess authorization factors, such as passwords and PINs.
		      Successful guessing of the authorization factors may cause the TOE to release DEKs or otherwise put it in a state
		      in which it discloses protected data to unauthorized users.

		      Threat agents may trick authorized users into storing chosen

		      with the chosen plaintext could allow attackers to recover the effective DEK, thus providing

		      Possession of any of the keys, authorization factors, submasks, and random

		      could allow an unauthorized user to defeat the encryption. The cPP considers possession of
		      key material of equal importance to the data itself. Threat agents may look for keying material
		      in unencrypted sectors of the storage device and on other peripherals in the operating environment
		      (OE), (e.g., BIOS configuration, SPI flash, or TPMs).

            Communication among and between product components (e.g., AA and EE) is

            product fulfils both cPPs, the communication between the components does not

            AA and EE, the physically close proximity of the two products during their operation
            means that the threat agent has very little opportunity to interpose itself in the

			  <description>
			    The OE provides a newly provisioned or initialized storage device free of protected data in

          Rationale: Since the cPP requires all protected data to be encrypted, A.INITIAL_DRIVE_STATE assumes
          that the initial state of the device targeted FDE is free of protected data in those areas of
          the drive where encryption will not be invoked (e.g., MBR, AA, or EE pre-authentication software).
          Given this known start state, the product (once installed and operational) ensures partitions of

                  chooses the applicable options within the selection. For example, the TOE may generate
                  random numbers with an approved RBG to create a DEK, as well as provide an interface to
                  accept a DEK from the environment.<h:br/><h:br/>

            This SFR must be included in the ST if selected in FCS_CKM_EXT.6.<h:br/><h:br/> 
            In the first selection, the ST Author is presented options for destroying disused cryptographic
            keys based on whether they are in volatile memory or non-volatile storage within the TOE. The 
            selection of block erase for non-volatile storage applies only to flash memory. A block erase
            does not require a read-verify, since the reference to the memory location is erased as well 
            as the data itself.<h:br/><h:br/>
            Within the selections is the option to overwrite the memory location with a new value of a key.
            The intent is that a new value of a key (as specified in another SFR within the cPP) can be used
            to “replace” an existing key.<h:br/><h:br/>
            Several selections allow assignment of a ‘value that does not contain any CSP’. This means
            that the TOE uses some other specified data not drawn from an RBG meeting FCS_RBG.1
            requirements, and not being any of the particular values listed as other selection options. The
            point of the phrase ‘does not contain any CSP’ is to ensure that the overwritten data is carefully
            selected, and not taken from a general ‘pool’ that might contain current or residual data that
            itself requires confidentiality protection.<h:br/><h:br/>
            Key destruction does not apply to the public component of asymmetric key pairs.

              (Key Management Description may be used if necessary details describe proprietary information)<h:br/><h:br/>
              The evaluator examines the TSS to ensure it describes how the keys are managed in volatile memory.
              This description includes details of how each identified key is introduced into volatile memory 
              (e.g. by derivation from user input, or by unwrapping a wrapped key stored in non-volatile memory)
              and how they are overwritten.<h:br/><h:br/>
              The evaluator shall check to ensure the TSS lists each type of key that is stored, and identifies 
              the memory type (volatile or non-volatile) where key material is stored.<h:br/><h:br/>
              The TSS identifies and describes the interfaces that is used to service commands to read/write 
              memory. The evaluator examines the interface description for each different media type to ensure
              that the interface supports the selections made by the ST Author.<h:br/><h:br/>
              If the ST makes use of the open assignment and fills in the type of pattern that is used, the 
              evaluator examines the TSS to ensure it describes how that pattern is obtained and used. The 
              evaluator shall verify that the pattern does not contain any CSPs.<h:br/><h:br/>
              The evaluator shall check that the TSS identifies any configurations or circumstances that
              may not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement.
            </TSS>
            <Guidance>
              There are a variety of concerns that may prevent or delay key destruction in some cases. The 
              evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation identifies configurations or circumstances
              that may not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement, and that this description is 
              consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS and any other relevant Required Supplementary 
              Information. The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation provides guidance on 
              situations where key destruction may be delayed at the physical layer.<h:br/><h:br/>
              For example, when the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is possible that 
              the storage may be implementing wear-leveling and garbage collection. This may create additional
              copies of the key that are logically inaccessible but persist physically. In this case, it is 
              assumed the drive supports the TRIM command and implements garbage collection to destroy these
              persistent copies when not actively engaged in other tasks.<h:br/><h:br/>
              Drive vendors implement garbage collection in a variety of different ways, as such there is a 
              variable amount of time until data is truly removed from these solutions. There is a risk that
              data may persist for a longer amount of time if it is contained in a block with other data not
              ready for erasure. It is assumed the operating system and file system of the OE support TRIM, 
              instructing the non-volatile memory to erase copies via garbage collection upon their deletion.<h:br/><h:br/>
              It is assumed that if a RAID array is being used, only set-ups that support TRIM are utilized. 
              It is assumed if the drive is connected via PCI-Express, the operating system supports TRIM over
              that channel. It is assumed the drive is healthy and contains minimal corrupted data and will be
              end of life before a significant amount of damage to drive health occurs, it is assumed there is
              a risk small amounts of potentially recoverable data may remain in damaged areas of the drive.<h:br/><h:br/>
              Finally, it is assumed the keys are not stored using a method that would be inaccessible to TRIM,
              such as being contained in a file less than 982 bytes which would be completely contained in the 
              master file table.
            </Guidance>
            <Tests>
              For these tests the evaluator shall utilize appropriate development environment (e.g. a Virtual Machine)
              and development tools (debuggers, simulators, etc.) to test that keys are erased, including all copies 
              of the key that may have been created internally by the TOE during normal cryptographic processing with
              that key.
              <testlist>
                <test>Applied to each key held as plaintext in volatile memory and subject to destruction by overwrite
                  by the TOE (whether or not the plaintext value is subsequently encrypted for storage in volatile or 
                  non-volatile memory). In the case where the only selection made for the destruction method key was 
                  removal of power, then this test is unnecessary. The evaluator shall:<h:ol type="1">
                    <h:li>Record the value of the key in the TOE subject to erasure.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Cause the TOE to perform a normal cryptographic processing with the key from Step #1.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Cause the TOE to erase the key.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Cause the TOE to stop the execution but not exit.</h:li>

                  </h:ol>
                  Steps 1-6 ensure that the complete key does not exist anywhere in volatile memory. If a copy is found,
                  then the test fails.<h:br/><h:br/>
                  Step 7 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in memory. If a fragment is found, there is a 
                  miniscule chance that it is not within the context of a key (e.g., some random bits that happen to match).
                  If this is the case the test should be repeated with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is found 
                  the test fails.

                  evaluator shall use special tools (as needed), provided by the TOE developer if necessary, to view the 
                  key storage location:<h:ol type="1">

                      a fragment is found in the repeated test then the test fails.</h:li>

                </test>
                <test>
                  Applied to each key held as non-volatile memory and subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE. 
                  The evaluator shall use special tools (as needed), provided by the TOE developer if necessary, to 
                  view the key storage location:<h:ol type="1">

                  The test succeeds if the correct pattern is used to overwrite the key in the
                  memory location. If the pattern is not found, the test fails.

            The interface referenced in the requirement could take different forms, the
            most likely of which is an application programming interface to an OS kernel. There may be
            various levels of abstraction visible. For instance, in a given implementation the application
            may have access to the file system details and may be able to logically address specific memory
            locations. In another implementation the application may simply have a handle to a resource
            and can only ask the platform to delete the resource. The level of detail to which the TOE has
            access will be reflected in the TSS section of the ST.<h:br/><h:br/>
            Several selections allow assignment of a ‘value that does not contain any CSP’. This means
            that the TOE uses some other specified data not drawn from an RBG meeting FCS_RBG.1
            requirements, and not being any of the particular values listed as other selection options. The
            point of the phrase ‘does not contain any CSP’ is to ensure that the overwritten data is carefully
            selected, and not taken from a general ‘pool’ that might contain current or residual data that
            itself requires confidentiality protection.<h:br/><h:br/>

              (Key Management Description may be used if necessary details describe proprietary information)<h:br/><h:br/>
              The evaluator examines the TSS to ensure it describes how the keys are managed in volatile memory.
              This description includes details of how each identified key is introduced into volatile memory (e.g.,
              by derivation from user input, or by unwrapping a wrapped key stored in non-volatile memory) and how 
              they are overwritten.<h:br/><h:br/>
              The evaluator shall check to ensure the TSS lists each type of key that is stored in non-volatile
              memory, and identifies how the TOE interacts with the underlying platform to manage keys (e.g., store,
              retrieve, destroy). The description includes details on the method of how the TOE interacts with the 
              platform, including an identification and description of the interfaces it uses to manage keys (e.g.,
              file system APIs, platform key store APIs).<h:br/><h:br/>
              The evaluator examines the interface description for each different media type to ensure that the 
              interface supports the selections and description in the TSS.<h:br/><h:br/>
              The evaluator shall check that the TSS identifies any configurations or circumstances that may not
              strictly conform to the key destruction requirement. If the ST makes use of the open assignment and
              fills in the type of pattern that is used, the evaluator examines the TSS to ensure it describes how
              that pattern is obtained and used. The evaluator shall verify that the pattern does not contain any
              CSPs.              
            </TSS>
            <Guidance>
              There are a variety of concerns that may prevent or delay key destruction in some cases. The evaluator
              shall check that the guidance documentation identifies configurations or circumstances that may not 
              strictly conform to the key destruction requirement, and that this description is consistent with the
              relevant parts of the TSS and any other relevant Required Supplementary Information. The evaluator 
              shall check that the guidance documentation provides guidance on situations where key destruction may
              be delayed at the physical layer.<h:br/><h:br/>
              For example, when the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is possible that the 
              storage may be implementing wear-leveling and garbage collection. This may create additional copies
              of the key that are logically inaccessible but persist physically. In this case, it is assumed the 
              drive supports the TRIM command and implements garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies
              when not actively engaged in other tasks.<h:br/><h:br/>
              Drive vendors implement garbage collection in a variety of different ways, as such there is a variable
              amount of time until data is truly removed from these solutions. There is a risk that data may persist
              for a longer amount of time if it is contained in a block with other data not ready for erasure. It is
              assumed the operating system and file system of the OE support TRIM, instructing the non-volatile memory
              to erase copies via garbage collection upon their deletion.<h:br/><h:br/>
              It is assumed that if a RAID array is being used, only set-ups that support TRIM are utilized. It is 
              assumed if the drive is connected via PCI-Express, the operating system supports TRIM over that channel.
              It is assumed the drive is healthy and contains minimal corrupted data and will be end of life before a 
              significant amount of damage to drive health occurs, it is assumed there is a risk small amounts of 
              potentially recoverable data may remain in damaged areas of the drive.<h:br/><h:br/>
              Finally, it is assumed the keys are not stored using a method that would be inaccessible to TRIM, such 
              as being contained in a file less than 982 bytes which would be completely contained in the master 
              file table.

            <Tests>
              <testlist>
                <test>Applied to each key held as plaintext in volatile memory and subject to destruction by overwrite
                  by the TOE (whether or not the plaintext value is subsequently encrypted for storage in volatile or 
                  non-volatile memory). In the case where the only selection made for the destruction method key was 
                  removal of power, then this test is unnecessary. The evaluator shall:<h:ol type="1">
                    <h:li>Record the value of the key in the TOE subject to erasure.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Cause the TOE to perform a normal cryptographic processing with the key from Step #1.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Cause the TOE to erase the key.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Cause the TOE to stop the execution but not exit.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Cause the TOE to dump the entire memory of the TOE into a binary file.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Search the content of the binary file created in Step #5 for instances of the known key value from Step #1.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Break the key value from Step #1 into 3 or 4 similar sized pieces and perform a search using each piece.</h:li>
                  </h:ol>
                  Steps 1-6 ensure that the complete key does not exist anywhere in volatile memory. If a copy is found,
                  then the test fails.<h:br/><h:br/>
                  Step 7 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in memory. If a fragment is found, there is a 
                  miniscule chance that it is not within the context of a key (e.g., some random bits that happen to match).
                  If this is the case the test should be repeated with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is found 
                  the test fails.
                </test>
              </testlist>
                The following tests apply only to selection a), since the TOE in this instance has more visibility into what is 
                happening within the underlying platform (e.g., a logical view of the media). In selection b), the TOE has no 
                visibility into the inner workings and completely relies on the underlying platform, so there is no reason to
                test the TOE beyond test 1.<h:br/><h:br/>
                For selection a), the following tests are used to determine the TOE is able to request the platform to overwrite
                the key with a TOE supplied pattern.
              <testlist>
                <test>
                  Applied to each key held in non-volatile memory and subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE. The 
                  evaluator shall use a tool that provides a logical view of the media (e.g., MBR
                  file system):<h:ol type="1">
                    <h:li>Record the value of the key in the TOE subject to erasure.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Cause the TOE to perform a normal cryptographic processing with the key from Step #1.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Cause the TOE to erase the key.</h:li>                    
                    <h:li>Search the logical view that the key was stored in for instances of the known key value from 
                      Step #1. If a copy is found, then the test fails.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Break the key value from Step #1 into 3 or 4 similar sized pieces and perform a search using each 
                      piece. If a fragment is found then the test is repeated (as described for Use
                      Case 1 test 1 above), and if a fragment is found in the repeated test then the test fails.</h:li>
                  </h:ol>
                </test>
                <test>
                  Applied to each key held as non-volatile memory and subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE. 
                  The evaluator shall use a tool that provides a logical view of the media:<h:ol type="1">
                    <h:li>Record the logical storage location of the key in the TOE subject to erasure.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Cause the TOE to perform a normal cryptographic processing with the key from Step #1.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Cause the TOE to erase the key.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Read the logical storage location in Step #1 of non-volatile memory to
                      ensure the appropriate pattern is used.</h:li>
                  </h:ol>
                  The test succeeds if the correct pattern is used to overwrite the key in the
                  memory location. If the pattern is not found, the test fails.

            This SFR must be included in the ST if selected in FCS_CKM_EXT.6.<h:br/><h:br/>
            In the first selection, the ST Author is presented options for destroying a
            key based on the memory or storage technology where keys are stored within the TOE.<h:br/><h:br/>
            If non-volatile memory is used to store keys, the ST Author selects whether the memory
            storage algorithm uses wear-leveling or not. Storage technologies or memory types that use
            wear-leveling are not required to perform a read verify. The selection for destruction
            includes block erase as an option, and this option applies only to flash memory. A block erase
            does not require a read verify, since the mappings of logical addresses to the erased memory
            locations are erased as well as the data itself.<h:br/><h:br/>    
            Within the selections is the option to overwrite a disused key with a new value of a key. The
            intent is that a new value of a key (as specified in another SFR within the cPP) can be used to
            “replace” an existing key.<h:br/><h:br/>
            If a selection for read verify is chosen, it should generate an audit record upon failures.<h:br/><h:br/>
            Several selections allow assignment of a ‘value that does not contain any CSP’. This means
            that the TOE uses some other specified data not drawn from an RBG meeting
            FCS_RBG.1 requirements, and not being any of the particular values listed as other
            selection options. The point of the phrase ‘does not contain any CSP’ is to ensure that the
            overwritten data is carefully selected, and not taken from a general ‘pool’ that might contain
            current or residual data that itself requires confidentiality protection.<h:br/><h:br/>
            Key destruction does not apply to the public component of asymmetric key pairs.

            <TSS>
              (Key Management Description may be used if necessary details describe proprietary information)<h:br/><h:br/>
              The evaluator examines the TSS to ensure it describes how the keys are managed in volatile memory.
              This description includes details of how each identified key is introduced into volatile memory (e.g.,
              by derivation from user input, or by unwrapping a wrapped key stored in non-volatile memory) and how 
              they are overwritten.<h:br/><h:br/>
              The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes the method that is used by the memory 
              controller to write and read memory from each type of memory listed. The purpose here is to provide
              a description of how the memory controller works so one can determine exactly how keys are written 
              to memory. The description would include how the data is written to and read from memory (e.g., block
              level, cell level), mechanisms for copies of the key that could potentially exist (e.g., a copy with 
              parity bits, a copy without parity bits, any mechanisms that are used for redundancy).<h:br/><h:br/>
              The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes the destruction procedure for each key that
              has been identified. If different types of memory are used to store the keys, the evaluator shall 
              check to ensure that the TSS identifies the destruction procedure for each memory type where keys are
              stored (e.g., key X stored in flash memory is destroyed by overwriting once with zeros, key X’ stored
              in EEPROM is destroyed by a overwrite consisting of a pseudo random pattern – the EEPROM used in the 
              TOE uses a wear-leveling scheme as described).<h:br/><h:br/>
              If the ST makes use of the open assignment and fills in the type of pattern that is used, the evaluator
              examines the TSS to ensure it describes how that pattern is obtained and used. The evaluator shall verify
              that the pattern does not contain any CSPs.<h:br/><h:br/>
              The evaluator shall check that the TSS identifies any configurations or circumstances that may not strictly
              conform to the key destruction requirement.<h:br/><h:br/>
              Upon completion of the TSS examination, the evaluator understands how all the keys
              (and potential copies) are destroyed.
                            
            </TSS>
            <Guidance>
              There are a variety of concerns that may prevent or delay key destruction in some cases. The evaluator
              shall check that the guidance documentation identifies configurations or circumstances that may not 
              strictly conform to the key destruction requirement, and that this description is consistent with 
              the relevant parts of the TSS and any other relevant Required Supplementary Information. The evaluator 
              shall check that the guidance documentation provides guidance on situations where key destruction may 
              be delayed at the physical layer.<h:br/><h:br/>
              For example, when the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is possible that the 
              storage may be implementing wear-leveling and garbage collection. This may create additional copies
              of the key that are logically inaccessible but persist physically. In this case, it is assumed the 
              drive supports the TRIM command and implements garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies
              when not actively engaged in other tasks.<h:br/><h:br/>
              Drive vendors implement garbage collection in a variety of different ways, as such there is a variable
              amount of time until data is truly removed from these solutions. There is a risk that data may persist
              for a longer amount of time if it is contained in a block with other data not ready for erasure. It is
              assumed the operating system and file system of the OE support TRIM, instructing the non-volatile memory
              to erase copies via garbage collection upon their deletion.<h:br/><h:br/>
              It is assumed that if a RAID array is being used, only set-ups that support TRIM are utilized. It is 
              assumed if the drive is connected via PCI-Express, the operating system supports TRIM over that channel.
              It is assumed the drive is healthy and contains minimal corrupted data and will be end of life before a 
              significant amount of damage to drive health occurs, it is assumed there is a risk small amounts of 
              potentially recoverable data may remain in damaged areas of the drive.<h:br/><h:br/>
              Finally, it is assumed the keys are not stored using a method that would be inaccessible to TRIM, such 
              as being contained in a file less than 982 bytes which would be completely contained in the master file
              table.<h:br/><h:br/>
              For destruction on wear-leveled memory, if a time period is required before is processed destruction the
              ST author shall provide an estimated range.
            </Guidance>
            <Tests>
              For these tests the evaluator shall use appropriate development environment (e.g. a Virtual Machine) and
              development tools (debuggers, simulators, etc.) to test that keys are erased, including all copies of 
              the key that may have been created internally by the TOE during normal cryptographic processing with that
              key.<h:br/><h:br/>
              For destruction on wear-leveled memory, if a time period is required before is evaluator shall wait that 
              amount of time after erasing the key in tests 2 and 3.
              <testlist>
                <test>Applied to each key held as plaintext in volatile memory and subject to destruction by overwrite
                  by the TOE (whether or not the plaintext value is subsequently encrypted for storage in volatile or 
                  non-volatile memory). In the case where the only selection made for the destruction method key was 
                  removal of power, then this test is unnecessary. The evaluator shall:<h:ol type="1">
                    <h:li>Record the value of the key in the TOE subject to erasure.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Cause the TOE to perform a normal cryptographic processing with the key from Step #1.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Cause the TOE to erase the key.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Cause the TOE to stop the execution but not exit.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Cause the TOE to dump the entire memory of the TOE into a binary file.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Search the content of the binary file created in Step #5 for instances of the known key value from Step #1.</h:li>
                    <h:li>Break the key value from Step #1 into 3 or 4 similar sized pieces and perform a search using each piece.</h:li>
                  </h:ol>
                  Steps 1-6 ensure that the complete key does not exist anywhere in volatile memory. If a copy is found,
                  then the test fails.<h:br/><h:br/>
                  Step 7 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in memory. If a fragment is found, there is a 
                  miniscule chance that it is not within the context of a key (e.g., some random bits that happen to match).
                  If this is the case the test should be repeated with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is found 
                  the test fails.

                      test 1 above), and if a fragment is found in the repeated test then the test fails.</h:li>
                  </h:ol>
                </test>
                <test>
                  Applied to each key held as non-volatile memory and subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE. 
                  The evaluator shall use special tools (as needed), provided by the TOE developer if necessary, to view the key storage location:<h:ol type="1">
                    <h:li>Record the logical storage location of the key in the TOE subject to erasure.</h:li>

                  </h:ol>
                  The test succeeds if the correct pattern is used to overwrite the key in the
                  memory location. If the pattern is not found, the test fails.

                  digital signature scheme. Based on the assignments and selections in the requirement,

                <h:p>It should be noted that for the schemes given below, there are no key generation/domain
                  parameter generation testing requirements. This is because it is not anticipated that this
                  functionality would be needed in the end device, since the functionality is limited to
                  checking digital signatures in delivered updates. This means that the domain
                  parameters should have already been generated and encapsulated in the hard drive
                  firmware or on-board non-volatile storage. If key generation/domain parameter
                  generation is required, the evaluation and validation scheme must be consulted to

					If KDF-CTR, KDF-FB, or KDF-DPI is claimed, then either FCS_COP.1/CMAC or FCS_COP.1/KeyedHash
					must also be claimed, depending on the selection made for PRF.<h:p/>
					If KDF-Hash is claimed, then FCS_COP.1/Hash must also be claimed.<h:p/>
					If KDF-MAC-1S is claimed, then FCS_COP.1/KeyedHash must also be claimed.<h:p/>
					If KDF-MAC-2S is claimed, then both FCS_COP.1/KeyedHash and FCS_COP.1/CMAC must also be claimed.<h:p/>
					In KDF-MAC-2S, CMAC has been removed as a selection for the MAC step because it requires
					selection of 128 bits for the output key size, which is not supported in CNSA 1.0. If HMAC is
					selected in the MAC step, then the same HMAC is used as the KDF.<h:p/>
					The security strengths of the Pseudo-Random functions for the key derivation methods must be 
					sufficient for the security strength of the keys derived through those methods. Since CNSA 1.0
					permits keys no smaller than 256 bits, no 128- or 192-bit PRFs are permitted. 
					If PBKDF2 is selected a salt must be generated per FCS_SNI_EXT.1.

				<aactivity>
					<TSS>
						The evaluator shall verify the TSS includes a description of the key derivation function
						and shall verify the key derivation function uses an approved derivation mode and key expansion
						algorithm according to list of standards.
					</TSS>
					<Guidance>
						The evaluator shall verify that the Guidance instructs the administrator how to set any configurable
						parameters, such as context strings, salts, and IVs.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall verify that the Guidance instructs the administrator how to configure the TOE to
						choose specific PRFs, modes, and parameters.
					</Guidance>	
					<KMD>
					The evaluator shall verify that the KMD describes and documents:<h:ul>
						<h:li>that the security strengths of the Pseudo-Random functions for the key 
							derivation methods are sufficient for the security strength of the keys derived through those
							methods.</h:li>
						<h:li>that the security strengths of the input parameters are sufficient for the security
							strength of the keys derived through these methods.</h:li>
						<h:li>that, if concatenated keys or intermediary keys are input parameters, the KMD describes
							the sources of the keys, and the order in which they are concatenated, along with any
							other values that are concatenated with them. This may occur in instances when input
							keying material for the KDF comes from two independent sources, for example, a client
							and a server.</h:li>
						<h:li>that, for KDF-MAC-1S, KDF-MAC-2S, and KDF-KMAC, the KMD documents that for
							each invocation of a KDF that reuses the same input shared secret or key, each invocation
							must use a distinct context string, IV, or salt. The KMD must also describe the composition
							and sizes of these input parameters. The evaluator must ensure that the context string, IV,
							and salt are generated in conformance with the relevant standards.</h:li>
						<h:li>that, if the TOE uses the derived key in a key chain/hierarchy, that KMD describes how the
							key is used as part of the key chain/hierarchy.</h:li>
						</h:ul>
					</KMD>
					<Tests>
						The evaluator shall perform the following test or witness respective tests 
						executed by the developer. The tests must be executed on a platform that is as 
						close as practically possible to the operational platform (but which may be 
						instrumented in terms of, for example, use of a debug mode). Where the test is
						not carried out on the TOE itself, the test platform shall be identified and
						the differences between test environment and TOE execution environment shall be
						described.<h:p/>

                  Key Chaining is the method of using multiple layers of encryption keys to ultimately secure the BEV. The number of intermediate keys will vary – from one 
                  (e.g., taking the conditioned password authorization factor and directly using it as the BEV) to many. This applies to all keys that contribute to the 
                  ultimate wrapping or derivation of the BEV; including those in areas of protected storage (e.g. TPM stored keys, comparison values).<h:br/><h:br/>
                  
                  Multiple key chains to the BEV are allowed, as long as all chains meet the key chain requirement.<h:br/><h:br/>
                  
                  The BEV is considered to be equivalent to keying material and therefore additional checksums or similar values are not the BEV, even if they are sent with
                  the BEV.<h:br/><h:br/> 
                
                  Once the ST author has selected a method to create the chain (either by deriving keys or unwrapping them or encrypting keys or using RSA Key Transport), they
                  pull the appropriate requirement out of Appendix B. It is allowable for an implementation to use any or all methods.<h:br/><h:br/>
                  
                  For FCS_KYC_EXT.1.2, the validation process is defined in FCS_VAL_EXT.1, Appendix B. If that selection is made by the ST author, then FCS_VAL_EXT.1 is included
                  in the body of the ST.
                  
                  The method the TOE uses to chain keys and manage/protect them is described in the Key Management Description; see Appendix E for more information.<h:br/><h:br/>
                
                  The TOE’s use of key encryption or key wrapping, key derivation, or submask combining determines whether the selection-based requirements 
                  FCS_COP.1/KeyEnc or FCS_COP.1/KeyWrap, FCS_CKM.5, and FCS_SMC_EXT.1 are claimed. Additionally, the TOE’s use of key encryption or key
                  wrapping for key chaining requires FCS_CKM.1/SKG and FCS_RBG.1 (for key generation) and FCS_COP.1/SKC (for symmetric encryption) to be claimed.

                The evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure it describes a high level key hierarchy and details of the key chain.
                The description of the key chain shall be reviewed to ensure it maintains a chain of keys using key wrap or key 
                derivation methods that meet FCS_CKM.5, FCS_COP.1/KeyWrap, FCS_COP.1/KeyEncap, and/or FCS_COP.1/KeyEnc.<h:br/><h:br/>
                
                The evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that it describes how the key chain process functions, such that it 
                does not expose any material that might compromise any key in the chain. (e.g. using a key directly as a compare 
                value against a TPM) This description must include a diagram illustrating the key hierarchy implemented and detail
                where all keys and keying material is stored or what it is derived from. The evaluator shall examine the key 
                hierarchy to ensure that at no point the chain could be broken without a cryptographic exhaust or knowledge 
                of the BEV and the effective strength of the DEK is maintained throughout the Key Chain.<h:br/><h:br/>

                    For Hash_DRBG and HMAC_DRBG, all allowed choices support a 256-bit security strength. For CTR_DRBG, the supported security strength is equal to the AES size. The TOE is expected to use a DRBG function that can support the security strength of the keys and random values to be generated. For example, an AES-192 CTR_DRBG can be used to generate 128-bit and 192-bit symmetric keys, but can not be used to generate 256-bit symmetric keys. More information is provided in Section 8.4 of NIST SP 800-90A.

                      The evaluator shall perform 15 trials for the DRBG implementation. If the DRBG
                      is configurable, the evaluator shall perform 15 trials for each configuration. The
                      evaluator shall also confirm that the operational guidance contains appropriate
                      instructions for configuring the DRBG functionality.
                    </h:p><h:p>
                      If the DRBG has  prediction resistance enabled, each trial consists of (1) instantiate DRBG, (2)
                      generate the first block of random bits (3) generate a second block of random bits
                      (4) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the second block of random bits is
                      the expected value. The evaluator shall generate eight input values for each
                      trial. The first is a count (0 – 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce, and
                      personalization string for the instantiate operation. The next two are additional

                    Using the entropy sources specified in FCS_RBG.4, the evaluator shall examine the entropy documentation required by FCS_RBG.1.2 to verify that it describes the method by which the various entropy sources are combined into a single seed. This should include an estimation of the rate at which each noise source outputs data and whether this is dependent on any system-specific factors so that each source's relative contribution to the overall entropy is understood. The evaluator shall verify that the resulting combination of sampled data and the min-entropy rate of the sampled data is described in sufficient detail to determine that sufficient entropy can be made available for the highest strength keys that the TSF can generate (e.g., 256 bits). If the seed data cannot be assumed to have full entropy (e.g., the min-entropy of the sampled bits is less than 1), the evaluator shall ensure that the entropy documentation describes the method by which the TOE estimates the amount of entropy that has been accumulated to ensure that sufficient data is collected and any conditioning that the TSF applies to the output data to create a seed of sufficient size with full entropy.

                  password crackers). The cryptographic functions (i.e., hash, decryption) performed are those specified in

            The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that the description is comprehensive in how the

            must make the case that standard methods of accessing the disk drive via the host platforms 
            operating system will pass through these functions.<h:br/><h:br/>
            For the cryptographic functions that are provided by the Operational Environment, the evaluator
            shall check the TSS to ensure it describes, for each platform identified in the ST, the interfaces
            used by the TOE to invoke this functionality.<h:br/><h:br/>
            The evaluator shall verify the TSS in performing the evaluation activities for this requirement.
            The evaluator shall ensure the comprehensiveness of the description, confirms how the TOE writes the
            data to the disk drive, and the point at which it applies the encryption function.<h:br/><h:br/>
            The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes the initialization of the TOE and the activities 
            the TOE performs to ensure that it encrypts all the storage devices entirely when a user or 
            administrator first provisions the TOE. The evaluator shall verify the TSS describes areas of the 
            disk that it does not encrypt (e.g., portions associated with the Master Boot Records (MBRs), boot
            loaders, partition tables, etc.). If the TOE supports multiple disk encryptions, the evaluator shall

            The evaluator shall review the AGD guidance to determine that it describes the initial steps needed to

            co-processor, for software: initialization of the product, drivers, libraries (if applicable), logical interfaces 
            for encryption/decryption, and areas which are not encrypted (e.g. boot loaders, portions associated with the Master 
            Boot Record (MBRs), partition tables, etc.)). The evaluator shall verify the KMD provides a functional (block) diagram 
            showing the main components (such as memories and processors) and the data path between, for hardware, the device’s 
            host interface and the device’s persistent media storing the data, or for software, the initial steps needed to the
            activities the TOE performs to ensure it encrypts the storage device entirely when a user or administrator first 
            provisions the product. The hardware encryption diagram shall show the location of the data encryption engine within 
            the data path. The evaluator shall validate that the hardware encryption diagram contains enough detail showing the 
            main components within the data path and that it clearly identifies the data encryption engine.<h:br/><h:br/>
            The evaluator shall verify the KMD provides sufficient instructions for all platforms to ensure that when the user

            the data flow from the device’s host interface to the device’s persistent media storing the data. The evaluator shall 
            verify that the KMD provides information on those conditions in which the data bypasses the data encryption engine 
            (e.g., read-write operations to an unencrypted Master Boot Record area).<h:br/><h:br/>
            The evaluator shall verify that the KMD provides a description of the platform’s boot initialization, the encryption 
            initialization process, and at what moment the product enables the encryption. The evaluator shall validate that the 
            product does not allow for the transfer of user data before it fully initializes the encryption.

                    The authenticated firmware update mechanism employs digital signatures to ensure the
                    authenticity of the firmware update image. The TSF provides a RTU that contains a signature

                    on the update image. The key store in the RTU should include a public key used to verify the
                    signature on an update image or a hash of the public key if a copy of the public key is provided
                    with the update image. In the latter case, the update mechanism should hash the public key
                    provided with the update image, and ensure that it matches a hash which appears in the key
                    store before using the provided public key to verify the signature on the update image. If the
                    hash of the public key is selected, the ST author may iterate the FCS_COP.1/Hash requirement -

    <h:p>This cPP identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to which
      the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs
      independent testing. Individual evaluation activities to be performed are specified within
      each SFR.
  </h:p><h:p>
    <h:b>Note to ST authors: There is a selection in the ASE_TSS that must be completed. One cannot simply reference the SARs in this cPP.</h:b>
  </h:p><h:p>
    The general model for evaluation of TOEs against STs written to conform to this cPP is as follows: after the ST has been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF will obtain the TOE, supporting environmental IT (if required), and the administrative/user guides for the TOE. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Evaluation Activities contained within the SD, which are intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the TOE. The Evaluation Activities that are captured in the SD also provide clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the TOE is compliant with the cPP.

  <section id="class-ate" title="Class ATE: Tests">
    Testing is specified for functional aspects of the system as well as aspects that take advantage of design or implementation weaknesses. The former is done through the ATE_IND family, while the latter is through the AVA_VAN family. For this cPP, testing is based on advertised functionality and interfaces with dependency on the availability of design information. One of the primary outputs of the evaluation process is the test report as specified in the following requirements.
    <a-component cc-id="ate_ind.1" name="Independent Testing – Conformance (ATE_IND.1)">
      Testing is performed to confirm the functionality described in the TSS as well as the operational guidance (includes “evaluated configuration” instructions). The focus of the testing is to confirm that the requirements specified in Section 5 are being met. The Evaluation Activities in the SD identify the specific testing activities necessary to verify compliance with the SFRs. The evaluator produces a test report documenting the plan for and results of testing, as well as coverage arguments focused on the platform/TOE combinations that are claiming conformance to this cPP.

            The evaluator shall prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing
            aspects of the system, including any application crashes during testing. The evaluator
            shall determine the root cause of any application crashes and include that information
            in the report. The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in
            the <xref to="bibCEM"/> and the body of this cPP’s evaluation activities.
          </h:p><h:p>
            While it is not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an evaluation activity, the
            evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
            the ST is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be tested, and for those
            platforms not included in the test plan but included in the ST, the test plan provides
            a justification for not testing the platforms. This justification must address the
            differences between the tested platforms and the untested platforms, and make an
            argument that the differences do not affect the testing to be performed. It is not
            sufficient to merely assert that the differences have no effect; rationale must be
            provided. If all platforms claimed in the ST are tested, then no rationale is
            necessary. The test plan describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and
            any setup that is necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It
            should be noted that the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for
            installation and setup of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard
            pre-test condition. This may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or
            tool, an argument (not just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool
            will not adversely affect the performance of the functionality by the TOE and its platform.
          </h:p><h:p>
            This also includes the configuration of the
            cryptographic engine to be used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this
            engine are those specified by this cPP and used by the cryptographic protocols being
            evaluated (e.g., SSH). The test plan identifies high-level test objectives
            as well as the test procedures to be followed to achieve those objectives. These
            procedures include expected results. 
          </h:p><h:p>
            The test report (which could just be an annotated
            version of the test plan) details the activities that took place when the test
            procedures were executed, and includes the actual results of the tests. This shall be
            a cumulative account, so if there was a test run that resulted in a failure; a fix
            installed; and then a successful re-run of the test, the report would show a “fail”
            and “pass” result (and the supporting details), and not just the “pass” result.

  <section id="class-ava" title="Class AVA: Vulnerability Assessment">
    For the current generation of this cPP, the iTC is expected to survey open sources to discover what vulnerabilities have been 
    discovered in these types of products and provide that content into the AVA_VAN discussion. In most cases, these vulnerabilities
    will require sophistication beyond that of a basic attacker. This information will be used in the development of future Protection
    Profiles.<h:br/><h:br/>
    If the TOE is a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device, the evaluator shall verify as part of the vulnerability assessment that 
    remote management services are either not present or can be fully disabled.<h:br/><h:br/>

      <h:b>Sources of Vulnerability Information</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
        CEM Work Unit AVA_VAN.1-3 is supplemented here to provide a better-defined set of flaws to 
        investigate and procedures to follow based on this particular technology. Terminology used is based on the flaw hypothesis
        methodology, where the evaluation team hypothesizes flaws and then either proves or disproves those flaws (a flaw is equivalent
        to a “potential vulnerability” as used in the CEM). Flaws are categorized into four “types” depending on how they are 
        formulated: <h:ol>
          <h:li>
            A list of flaw hypotheses applicable to the technology described by the cPP derived from public sources as documented in 
            the Type 1 Hypotheses section—this fixed set has been agreed to by the iTC. Additionally, this will be supplemented with entries for a set
            of public sources (as indicated below) that are directly applicable to the TOE or its identified components (as defined by 
            the process in the Type 1 Hypotheses section below); this is to ensure that the evaluators include in their assessment applicable entries 
            that have been discovered since the cPP was published;
          </h:li>
          <h:li>
            A list of flaw hypotheses contained in this document that are derived from lessons learned specific to that technology and
            other iTC input (that might be derived from other open sources and vulnerability databases, for example) as documented in 
            the Type 2 Hypotheses section;
          </h:li>
          <h:li>
            A list of flaw hypotheses derived from information available to the evaluators; this includes the baseline evidence 
            provided by the vendor described in this document (documentation associated with EAs, documentation described in
            the Vulnerability Survey section), as well as other information (public and/or based on evaluator experience) as documented in the Type 3 Hypotheses
            section; and
          </h:li>
          <h:li>
            A list of flaw hypotheses that are generated through the use of iTC-defined tools (e.g., nmap, protocol testers) and their
            application is specified in the Type 4 Hypotheses section.
          </h:li>
        </h:ol>
      <h:b><h:i>Type 1 Hypotheses-Public-Vulnerability-Based</h:i></h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
        The following list of public sources of vulnerability information was selected by the iTC:
        <h:ol type="a">
          <h:li>Search Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures: http://cve.mitre.org/cve/</h:li>
          <h:li>Search the National Vulnerability Database: https://nvd.nist.gov/</h:li>
          <h:li>Search US-CERT: http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/html/search</h:li>
        </h:ol>
        The list of sources above was searched with the following search terms:
        <h:ul>
          <h:li>General (for all) <h:ul>
            <h:li>Product name</h:li>
            <h:li>Underlying components (e.g., OS, software libraries (crypto libraries), chipsets)</h:li>
            <h:li>Drive encryption, disk encryption</h:li>
            <h:li>Key destruction and sanitization</h:li>
          </h:ul></h:li>          
          <h:li>For Software FDE (AA or EE) <h:ul>
            <h:li>Key caching</h:li>
          </h:ul></h:li></h:ul>
      In order to successfully complete this activity, the evaluator will use the developer provided list of all of third party library
      information that is used as part of their product, along with the version and any other identifying information (this is required
      in the cPP as part of the ASE_TSS.1.1C requirement). This applies to hardware (including chipsets, etc.) that a vendor utilizes 
      as part of their TOE. This TOE-unique information will be used in the search terms the evaluator uses in addition to those listed
      above.<h:br/><h:br/>
      The evaluator will also consider the requirements that are chosen and the appropriate guidance that is tied to each requirement.<h:br/><h:br/>
      In order to supplement this list, the evaluators shall also perform a search on the sources listed above to determine a list of 
      potential flaw hypotheses that are more recent that the publication date of the cPP, and those that are specific to the TOE and
      its components as specified by the additional documentation mentioned above. Any duplicates – either in a specific entry, or in
      the flaw hypothesis that is generated from an entry from the same or a different source – can be noted and removed from 
      consideration by the evaluation team.<h:br/><h:br/>
      As part of type 1 flaw hypothesis generation for the specific components of the TOE, the evaluator shall also search the 
      component manufacturer’s websites to determine if flaw hypotheses can be generated on this basis (for instance, if security 
      patches have been released for the version of the component being evaluated, the subject of those patches may form the basis 
      for a flaw hypothesis).<h:br/><h:br/>
      <h:b><h:i>Type 2 Hypotheses-iTC-Sourced</h:i></h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
      There are no type 2 hypotheses.
      <h:br/><h:br/>
      <h:b><h:i>Type 3 Hypotheses-Evaluation-Team-Generated</h:i></h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
          The iTC has leveraged the expertise of the developers and the evaluation labs to diligently develop the appropriate search
          terms and vulnerability databases. They have also thoughtfully considered the iTC-sourced hypotheses the evaluators should
          use based upon the applicable use case and the threats to be mitigated by the SFRs. Therefore, it is the intent of the iTC,
          for the evaluation to focus all effort on the Type 1 and Type 2 Hypotheses and has decided that Type 3 Hypotheses are not 
          necessary.<h:br/><h:br/>
          However, if the evaluators discover a Type 3 potential flaw that they believe should be considered, they should work with 
          their Certification Body to determine the feasibility of pursuing the hypothesis. The Certification Body may determine 
          whether the potential flaw hypotheses is worth submitting to the iTC for consideration as Type 2 hypotheses in future drafts 
          of the cPP/SD.<h:br/><h:br/>
      <h:b><h:i>Type 4 Hypotheses-Evaluation-Team-Generated</h:i></h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
          The iTC has called out several tools that should be used during the Type 2 hypotheses process. Therefore, the use of any tools
          is covered within the Type 2 construct and the iTC does not see any additional tools that are necessary. The use case for 
          Version 2 of this cPP is rather straightforward – the device is found in a powered down state and has not been subjected to
          revisit/evil maid attacks. Since that is the use case, the iTC has also assumed there is a trusted channel between the AA and
          EE. Since the use case is so narrow, and is not a typical model for penetration or fuzzing testing, the normal types of 
          testing do not apply. Therefore, the relevant types of tools are referenced in Type 2.<h:br/><h:br/>
      <h:b>Process for Evaluator Vulnerability Analysis</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
          As flaw hypotheses are generated from the activities described above, the evaluation team will disposition them; that is, 
          attempt to prove, disprove, or determine the non-applicability of the hypotheses. This process is as follows.
          The evaluator will refine each flaw hypothesis for the TOE and attempt to disprove it using the information provided by the
          developer or through penetration testing. During this process, the evaluator is free to interact directly with the developer
          to determine if the flaw exists, including requests to the developer for additional evidence (e.g., detailed design 
          information, consultation with engineering staff); however, the CB should be included in these discussions. Should the
          developer object to the information being requested as being not compatible with the overall level of the evaluation 
          activity/cPP and cannot provide evidence otherwise that the flaw is disproved, the evaluator prepares an appropriate set of
          materials as follows:
          <h:ul>
            <h:li>The source documents used in formulating the hypothesis, and why it represents a potential compromise against a 
              specific TOE function;</h:li>
            <h:li>An argument why the flaw hypothesis could not be proven or disproved by the evidence provided so far; and</h:li>
            <h:li>The type of information required to investigate the flaw hypothesis further.</h:li>
          </h:ul>
          The Certification Body (CB) will then either approve or disapprove the request for additional information. If approved, the
          developer provides the requested evidence to disprove the flaw hypothesis (or, of course, acknowledge the flaw).<h:br/><h:br/>
          For each hypothesis, the evaluator will note whether the flaw hypothesis has been successfully disproved, successfully proven
          to have identified a flaw, or requires further investigation. It is important to have the results documented as outlined in 
          the Reporting section below.
          If the evaluator finds a flaw, the evaluator must report these flaws to the developer. All reported flaws must be addressed 
          as follows:<h:br/><h:br/>
          If the developer confirms that the flaw exists and that it is exploitable at Basic Attack Potential, then a change is made by
          the developer, and the resulting resolution is agreed by the evaluator and noted as part of the evaluation report.<h:br/><h:br/>
          If the developer, the evaluator, and the CB agree that the flaw is exploitable only above Basic Attack Potential and does not 
          require resolution for any other reason, then no change is made and the flaw is noted as a residual vulnerability in the 
          CB-internal report (ETR).<h:br/><h:br/>
          If the developer and evaluator agree that the flaw is exploitable only above Basic Attack Potential, but it is deemed critical
          to fix because of technology-specific or cPP-specific aspects such as typical use cases or operational environments, then a 
          change is made by the developer, and the resulting resolution is agreed by the evaluator and noted as part of the evaluation
          report.<h:br/><h:br/>
          Disagreements between evaluator and vendor regarding questions of the existence of a flaw, its attack potential, or whether
          it should be deemed critical to fix are resolved by the CB.<h:br/><h:br/>
          Any testing performed by the evaluator shall be documented in the test report as outlined
          in the Reporting section below.<h:br/><h:br/>
          As indicated in the Reporting section, the public statement with respect to vulnerability analysis that is performed on TOEs 
          conformant to the cPP is constrained to coverage of flaws associated with Types 1 and 2 (defined in the Sources of 
          Vulnerability Information section) flaw hypotheses only. The fact that the iTC generates these candidate hypotheses indicates 
          these must be addressed.<h:br/><h:br/>
      <h:b>Reporting</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
          The evaluators shall produce two reports on the testing effort; one that is public-facing (that is, included in the 
          non-proprietary evaluation report, which is a subset of the Evaluation Technical Report (ETR)), and the complete ETR that is 
          delivered to the overseeing CB.<h:br/><h:br/>
          The public-facing report contains:<h:ul>
          <h:li>The flaw identifiers returned when the procedures for searching public sources were followed according to instructions in
            the Type 1 Hypotheses section;</h:li>

          </h:ul>
          No other information is provided in the public-facing report.<h:br/><h:br/>

<appendix id="apndx-entropy" title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment">
  <h:p><h:i>This is an optional appendix in the cPP, and only applies if the TOE is providing deterministic random bit generation services, e.g. the ST claims FCS_RBG.1.</h:i></h:p>
  <h:p>This appendix describes the required supplementary information for each entropy source used by the TOE.</h:p>
  <h:p>The documentation of the entropy sources should be detailed enough that, after reading, the evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide sufficient entropy. This documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation is not required to be part of the TSS in the public facing ST. 
    </h:p>
    <section id="sec-ent-design" title="Design Description">
      <h:p>Documentation shall include the design of each entropy source as a whole, including the interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the product. </h:p>
      <h:p>The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source design indicating where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking) should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.</h:p>
      <h:p>This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate.</h:p>
      <h:p>If implemented, the design description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included.</h:p>
    </section>
    <section id="sec-ent-justification" title="Entropy Justification">
      <h:p>There should be a technical argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence in the entropy source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by this particular TOE). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that sufficient entropy is going into the TOE randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with entropy.</h:p>
      <h:p>The amount of information necessary to justify the expected min-entropy rate depends on the type of entropy source included in the product.</h:p>
      <h:p>For developer provided entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number of raw source bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the min-entropy rate determined from the statistical tests. While no particular statistical tests are required at this time, it is expected that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount of min-entropy in each output. </h:p>
      <h:p>For third party provided entropy sources, in which the TOE vendor has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy obtained from this third-party source. It is acceptable for the vendor to “assume” an amount of min-entropy, however, this assumption must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular, the min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included in the ST.</h:p>
      <h:p>Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is initialized with the entropy stated in the ST, for example by verifying that the min-entropy rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of entropy expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared to the statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or the calculated rate is not explicitly related to the seed, the documentation will not be considered complete.</h:p>
      <h:p>The entropy justification shall not include any data added from any third-party application or from any state saving between restarts.</h:p>
    </section>
    <section id="sec-ent-oc" title="Operating Conditions">The entropy rate may be affected by conditions outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage, frequency, temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may affect the operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. Similarly, documentation shall describe the conditions under which the entropy source is no longer guaranteed to provide sufficient entropy. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included.</section>
    <section id="s-ent-health" title="Health Testing">More specifically, all entropy source health tests and their rationale will be documented. This will include a description of the health tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at startup, continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, TOE behavior upon entropy source failure, and rationale indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in the entropy source.</section>
</appendix>
<appendix id="apndx-keyMan" title="Key Management Description">
  <h:p>The documentation of the product’s encryption key management should be detailed enough that, after reading, the evaluator will thoroughly understand the product’s key management and how it meets the requirements to ensure the keys are adequately protected. This documentation should include an essay and diagrams. This documentation is not required to be part of the TSS - it can be submitted as a separate document and marked as developer proprietary.</h:p>
  <h:p>Essay:</h:p>
  <h:p>The essay will provide the following information for all keys in the key chain:</h:p>
  <h:p><h:ul>
    <h:li>The purpose of the key</h:li>
    <h:li>If the key is stored in non-volatile memory</h:li>
    <h:li>How and when the key is protected</h:li>
    <h:li>How and when the key is derived</h:li>
    <h:li>The strength of the key</h:li>
    <h:li>When or if the key would be no longer needed, along with a justification.</h:li>
  </h:ul>The essay will also describe the following topics:</h:p>
  <h:p><h:ul>
    <h:li>A description of all authorization factors that are supported by the product and how each factor is handled, including any conditioning and combining performed.</h:li>
    <h:li>If validation is supported, the process for validation shall be described, noting what value is used for validation and the process used to perform the validation. It shall describe how this process ensures no keys in the key chain are weakened or exposed by this process.</h:li>
    <h:li>The authorization process that leads to the ultimate release of the BEV. This section shall detail the key chain used by the product. It shall describe which keys are used in the protection of the BEV and how they meet the derivation, key wrap, or a combination of the two requirements, including the direct chain from the initial authorization to the BEV. It shall also include any values that add into that key chain or interact with the key chain and the protections that ensure those values do not weaken or expose the overall strength of the key chain.</h:li>
    <h:li>The diagram and essay will clearly illustrate the key hierarchy to ensure that at no point the chain could be broken without a cryptographic exhaust or all of the initial authorization values and the effective strength of the BEV is maintained throughout the Key Chain. 
      </h:li>
    <h:li>A description of the data encryption engine, its components, and details about its implementation (e.g. for hardware: integrated within the device’s main SOC or separate co-processor, for software: initialization of the product, drivers, libraries (if applicable), logical interfaces for encryption/decryption, and areas which are not encrypted (e.g. boot loaders, portions associated with the Master Boot Record (MBRs), partition tables, etc.)). The description should also include the data flow from the device’s host interface to the device’s persistent media storing the data, information on those conditions in which the data bypasses the data encryption engine (e.g. read-write operations to an unencrypted Master Boot Record area). The description should be detailed enough to verify all platforms to ensure that when the user enables encryption, the product encrypts all hard storage devices. It should also describe the platform’s boot initialization, the encryption initialization process, and at what moment the product enables the encryption.</h:li>
    <h:li>The process for destroying keys when they are no longer needed by describing the storage location of all keys and the protection of all keys stored in non-volatile memory.</h:li>

  </h:ul></h:p>
  <h:p>Diagram:
  </h:p>
  <h:p>
    <h:ul>
      <h:li>The diagram will include all keys from the initial authorization factors to the BEV and any keys or values that contribute into the chain. It must list the cryptographic strength of each key and indicate how each key along the chain is protected with either Key Derivation or Key Wrapping (from the allowed options). The diagram should indicate the input used to derive or unwrap each key in the chain.</h:li>
      <h:li>A functional (block) diagram showing the main components (such as memories and processors) and the data path between, for hardware, the device’s host interface and the device’s persistent media storing the data, or for software, the initial steps needed for the activities the TOE performs to ensure it encrypts the storage device entirely when a user or administrator first provisions the product. The hardware encryption diagram shall show the location of the data encryption engine within the data path.</h:li>
      <h:li>The hardware encryption diagram shall show the location of the data encryption engine within the data path. The evaluator shall validate that the hardware encryption diagram contains enough detail showing the main components within the data path and that it clearly identifies the data encryption engine. </h:li>
    </h:ul>
