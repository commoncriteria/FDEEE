    to describe the security functionality of 
    
    products in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.

    </p><p> 
Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id="structure" class="indexable" data-level="1">1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation, then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of assurance components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an assurance component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the assurance component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the assurance component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

    While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where 
    it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the 
    developer may have existing tests. 
    Therefore, it is acceptable for the evaluator to witness developer-generated 
    tests in lieu of executing the tests. 
    In this case, the evaluator must ensure the developer’s tests are executing both 
    in the manner declared by the developer and as mandated by the EA.

                        be delayed at the physical layer.</p>
                      <p>For example, when the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is
                        possible that the storage may be implementing wear-leveling and garbage collection.
                        This may create additional copies of the key that are logically inaccessible but persist
                        physically. In this case, it is assumed the drive supports the TRIM command and
                        implements garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies when not actively
                        engaged in other tasks. </p>
                      <p>Drive vendors implement garbage collection in a variety of different ways, as such
                        there is a variable amount of time until data is truly removed from these solutions.
                        There is a risk that data may persist for a longer amount of time if it is contained in a
                        block with other data not ready for erasure. It is assumed the operating system and file
                        system of the OE support TRIM, instructing the non-volatile memory to erase copies
                        via garbage collection upon their deletion. </p>
                      <p>It is assumed that if a RAID array is being used, only set-ups that support TRIM are
                        utilized. It is assumed if the drive is connected via PCI-Express, the operating system
                        supports TRIM over that channel. It is assumed the drive is healthy and contains minimal corrupted data and will be end of life before a significant amount of damage
                        to drive health occurs, it is assumed there is a risk small amounts of potentially
                        recoverable data may remain in damaged areas of the drive.</p>
                      <p>Finally, it is assumed the keys are not stored using a method that would be inaccessible
                        to TRIM, such as being contained in a file less than 982 bytes which would be
                        completely contained in the master file table.</p></div>

              The evaluator examines the TSS to ensure it describes how the keys are managed in volatile memory.
              This description includes details of how each identified key is introduced into volatile memory 
              (e.g. by derivation from user input, or by unwrapping a wrapped key stored in non-volatile memory)
              and how they are overwritten.<br/><br/>
              The evaluator shall check to ensure the TSS lists each type of key that is stored, and identifies 
              the memory type (volatile or non-volatile) where key material is stored.<br/><br/>
              The TSS identifies and describes the interfaces that is used to service commands to read/write 
              memory. The evaluator examines the interface description for each different media type to ensure
              that the interface supports the selections made by the ST Author.<br/><br/>
              If the ST makes use of the open assignment and fills in the type of pattern that is used, the 
              evaluator examines the TSS to ensure it describes how that pattern is obtained and used. The 
              evaluator shall verify that the pattern does not contain any CSPs.<br/><br/>
              The evaluator shall check that the TSS identifies any configurations or circumstances that
              may not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement.
            </div></div><div class="eacategory">Guidance</div><div class="ea"><div class="ea">
              There are a variety of concerns that may prevent or delay key destruction in some cases. The 
              evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation identifies configurations or circumstances
              that may not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement, and that this description is 
              consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS and any other relevant Required Supplementary 
              Information. The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation provides guidance on 
              situations where key destruction may be delayed at the physical layer.<br/><br/>
              For example, when the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is possible that 
              the storage may be implementing wear-leveling and garbage collection. This may create additional
              copies of the key that are logically inaccessible but persist physically. In this case, it is 
              assumed the drive supports the TRIM command and implements garbage collection to destroy these
              persistent copies when not actively engaged in other tasks.<br/><br/>
              Drive vendors implement garbage collection in a variety of different ways, as such there is a 
              variable amount of time until data is truly removed from these solutions. There is a risk that
              data may persist for a longer amount of time if it is contained in a block with other data not
              ready for erasure. It is assumed the operating system and file system of the OE support TRIM, 
              instructing the non-volatile memory to erase copies via garbage collection upon their deletion.<br/><br/>
              It is assumed that if a RAID array is being used, only set-ups that support TRIM are utilized. 
              It is assumed if the drive is connected via PCI-Express, the operating system supports TRIM over
              that channel. It is assumed the drive is healthy and contains minimal corrupted data and will be
              end of life before a significant amount of damage to drive health occurs, it is assumed there is
              a risk small amounts of potentially recoverable data may remain in damaged areas of the drive.<br/><br/>
              Finally, it is assumed the keys are not stored using a method that would be inaccessible to TRIM,
              such as being contained in a file less than 982 bytes which would be completely contained in the 
              master file table.

              For these tests the evaluator shall utilize appropriate development environment (e.g. a Virtual Machine)
              and development tools (debuggers, simulators, etc.) to test that keys are cleared, including all copies 
              of the key that may have been created internally by the TOE during normal cryptographic processing with
              that key.

              The evaluator shall check to ensure the TSS lists each type of key that is stored in non-volatile

              retrieve, destroy). The description includes details on the method of how the TOE interacts with the 
              platform, including an identification and description of the interfaces it uses to manage keys (e.g.,
              file system APIs, platform key store APIs).<br/><br/>
              The evaluator examines the interface description for each different media type to ensure that the

              There are a variety of concerns that may prevent or delay key destruction in some cases. The evaluator
              shall check that the guidance documentation identifies configurations or circumstances that may not 
              strictly conform to the key destruction requirement, and that this description is consistent with the
              relevant parts of the TSS and any other relevant Required Supplementary Information. The evaluator 
              shall check that the guidance documentation provides guidance on situations where key destruction may
              be delayed at the physical layer.<br/><br/>
              For example, when the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is possible that the 
              storage may be implementing wear-leveling and garbage collection. This may create additional copies
              of the key that are logically inaccessible but persist physically. In this case, it is assumed the 
              drive supports the TRIM command and implements garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies
              when not actively engaged in other tasks.<br/><br/>
              Drive vendors implement garbage collection in a variety of different ways, as such there is a variable
              amount of time until data is truly removed from these solutions. There is a risk that data may persist
              for a longer amount of time if it is contained in a block with other data not ready for erasure. It is
              assumed the operating system and file system of the OE support TRIM, instructing the non-volatile memory
              to erase copies via garbage collection upon their deletion.<br/><br/>
              It is assumed that if a RAID array is being used, only set-ups that support TRIM are utilized. It is 
              assumed if the drive is connected via PCI-Express, the operating system supports TRIM over that channel.
              It is assumed the drive is healthy and contains minimal corrupted data and will be end of life before a 
              significant amount of damage to drive health occurs, it is assumed there is a risk small amounts of 
              potentially recoverable data may remain in damaged areas of the drive.<br/><br/>
              Finally, it is assumed the keys are not stored using a method that would be inaccessible to TRIM, such 
              as being contained in a file less than 982 bytes which would be completely contained in the master 
              file table.

                  Steps 1-6 ensure that the complete key does not exist anywhere in volatile memory. If a copy is found,
                  then the test fails.<br/><br/>
                  Step 7 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in memory. If a fragment is found, there is a 
                  miniscule chance that it is not within the context of a key (e.g., some random bits that happen to match).
                  If this is the case the test should be repeated with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is found 
                  the test fails.

                The following tests apply only to selection a), since the TOE in this instance has more visibility into what is 
                happening within the underlying platform (e.g., a logical view of the media). In selection b), the TOE has no 
                visibility into the inner workings and completely relies on the underlying platform, so there is no reason to
                test the TOE beyond test 1.<br/><br/>
                For selection a), the following tests are used to determine the TOE is able to request the platform to overwrite

              The evaluator examines the TSS to ensure it describes how the keys are managed in volatile memory.
              This description includes details of how each identified key is introduced into volatile memory (e.g.,

              they are overwritten.<br/><br/>
              The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes the method that is used by the memory 
              controller to write and read memory from each type of memory listed. The purpose here is to provide
              a description of how the memory controller works so one can determine exactly how keys are written 
              to memory. The description would include how the data is written to and read from memory (e.g., block
              level, cell level), mechanisms for copies of the key that could potentially exist (e.g., a copy with 
              parity bits, a copy without parity bits, any mechanisms that are used for redundancy).<br/><br/>
              The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes the destruction procedure for each key that
              has been identified. If different types of memory are used to store the keys, the evaluator shall 
              check to ensure that the TSS identifies the destruction procedure for each memory type where keys are
              stored (e.g., key X stored in flash memory is destroyed by overwriting once with zeros, key X’ stored
              in EEPROM is destroyed by a overwrite consisting of a pseudo random pattern – the EEPROM used in the 
              TOE uses a wear-leveling scheme as described).<br/><br/>
              If the ST makes use of the open assignment and fills in the type of pattern that is used, the evaluator
              examines the TSS to ensure it describes how that pattern is obtained and used. The evaluator shall verify
              that the pattern does not contain any CSPs.<br/><br/>
              The evaluator shall check that the TSS identifies any configurations or circumstances that may not strictly
              conform to the key destruction requirement.<br/><br/>
              Upon completion of the TSS examination, the evaluator understands how all the keys

                    Using the entropy sources specified in FCS_RBG.4, the evaluator shall examine the entropy documentation required by FCS_RBG.1.2 to verify that it describes the method by which the various entropy sources are combined into a single seed. This should include an estimation of the rate at which each noise source outputs data and whether this is dependent on any system-specific factors so that each source's relative contribution to the overall entropy is understood. The evaluator shall verify that the resulting combination of sampled data and the min-entropy rate of the sampled data is described in sufficient detail to determine that sufficient entropy can be made available for the highest strength keys that the TSF can generate (e.g., 256 bits). If the seed data cannot be assumed to have full entropy (e.g., the min-entropy of the sampled bits is less than 1), the evaluator shall ensure that the entropy documentation describes the method by which the TOE estimates the amount of entropy that has been accumulated to ensure that sufficient data is collected and any conditioning that the TSF applies to the output data to create a seed of sufficient size with full entropy.

            If cryptographic functions are provided by the

            The documentation must describe the process for verifying

            be done by the TOE or the underlying platform.

            <li>Instructions for initiating the update process, as well as discerning whether the process was 
              successful or unsuccessful. This includes generation of the digital signature. 
              The TOE will likely contain security functionality that does not 
              fall in the scope of evaluation under this PP. The operational guidance shall make it 
              clear to an administrator which security functionality is covered by the evaluation

          environment to support TOE functional requirements. The evaluator

          and TOE samples received for testing to ensure that the version

          The "evaluation evidence required by the SARs" in this PP is limited to the
          information in the ST coupled with the guidance provided to administrators and users
          under the AGD requirements. By ensuring that the TOE is specifically
          identified and that this identification is consistent in the ST and in the AGD
          guidance (as done in the evaluation activity for ALC_CMC.1), the evaluator implicitly
          confirms the information required by this component. Life-cycle support is targeted
          aspects of the developer’s life-cycle and instructions to providers of applications
          for the developer’s devices, rather than an in-depth examination of the TSF
          manufacturer’s development and configuration management process.
          This is not meant to diminish the critical role that a developer’s practices play in
          contributing to the overall trustworthiness of a product; rather, it’s a reflection on
          the information to be made available for evaluation.
          
          <p>
            The evaluator shall ensure that the developer has identified (in guidance documentation for application
            developers concerning the targeted platform) one or more development environments
            appropriate for use in developing applications for the developer’s platform. For each
            of these development environments, the developer shall provide information on how to
            configure the environment to ensure that buffer overflow protection mechanisms in the
            environments are invoked (e.g., compiler flags). The evaluator shall ensure that
            this documentation also includes an indication of whether such protections are on by
            default, or have to be specifically enabled. The evaluator shall ensure that the 
            TSF is uniquely identified (with respect to other products from the 
            TSF vendor), and that documentation provided by the developer in 
            association with the requirements in the ST is associated with the

            The evaluator shall prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing
            aspects of the system, including any application crashes during testing. The evaluator
            shall determine the root cause of any application crashes and include that information

            the <a href="#bibCEM" class="dynref" data-format=""></a> and the body of this PP’s evaluation activities.
          </p><p>
            While it is not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an evaluation activity, the
            evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
            the ST is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be tested, and for those
            platforms not included in the test plan but included in the ST, the test plan provides
            a justification for not testing the platforms. This justification must address the
            differences between the tested platforms and the untested platforms, and make an
            argument that the differences do not affect the testing to be performed. It is not
            sufficient to merely assert that the differences have no effect; rationale must be
            provided. If all platforms claimed in the ST are tested, then no rationale is
            necessary. The test plan describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and
            any setup that is necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It
            should be noted that the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for
            installation and setup of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard
            pre-test condition. This may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or
            tool, an argument (not just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool
            will not adversely affect the performance of the functionality by the TOE and its platform.
          </p><p>
            This also includes the configuration of the
            cryptographic engine to be used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this
            engine are those specified by this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being
            evaluated (e.g., SSH). The test plan identifies high-level test objectives
            as well as the test procedures to be followed to achieve those objectives. These
            procedures include expected results. 
          </p><p>
            The test report (which could just be an annotated
            version of the test plan) details the activities that took place when the test
            procedures were executed, and includes the actual results of the tests. This shall be
            a cumulative account, so if there was a test run that resulted in a failure; a fix
            installed; and then a successful re-run of the test, the report would show a “fail”
            and “pass” result (and the supporting details), and not just the “pass” result.

          <p>
            The evaluator shall generate a report to document their findings with respect to this 
            requirement. This report could physically be part of the overall test report mentioned in
            ATE_IND, or a separate document. The evaluator performs a search of public information to find
            vulnerabilities that have been found in similar applications with a particular focus on network 
            protocols the application uses and document formats it parses.
          </p><p>
            The evaluator documents the sources consulted and the vulnerabilities found in the report.
          </p><p>
            For each vulnerability found, the evaluator either provides a rationale with respect to its 
            non-applicability, or the evaluator formulates a test (using the guidelines provided in ATE_IND)
            to confirm the vulnerability, if suitable. Suitability is determined by assessing the attack 
            vector needed to take advantage of the vulnerability. If exploiting the vulnerability requires
            expert skills and an electron microscope, for instance, then a test would not be suitable and 
            an appropriate justification would be formulated.
